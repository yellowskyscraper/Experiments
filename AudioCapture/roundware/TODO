- menu on device does not work to open PP
- play buttons turn to stop when playing, but not back to play when end of stream happens.
-  when you hit record, it skips over the actual recording and goes right to the submit/listen page - surprisingly, no error on client or server is thrown that I can see. (actually, when I hit play I  get this error:  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/roundclient/gui_helper.py", line 76, in release

ERRORS

- when PT Exhibit Overview artwork selected for listening:   File "./client.py", line 453, in on_demographics_okay_clicked
   self.goto_listen_page()
 File "./client.py", line 363, in goto_listen_page
   self.wTree.get_widget("educators_checkbutton").get_active(),
 File "./client.py", line 582, in listen_selections_text
   if artwork: str += "<b>" + artwork["artist_name"] + ":</b> <i>" + artwork["name"] + "</i>"
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'NoneType' objects

- when Aldrich is supposed to playback:

- when selecting CO or Aldrich for speaking, it gives wrong questions and has error:  Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "./client.py", line 353, in on_category_clicked
   self.goto_page_after_artwork()
 File "./client.py", line 384, in goto_page_after_artwork
   self.initialize_question_page(self.current_artwork["id"])
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is unsubscriptable

PRIORITY LIST:
* icon to start the program
* it would ideally start at a randomized location each time, fading in of
  course! – whole stream stops at end of mp3 now.
* Mp3 of music doesn't loop…not sure if it ever did, but it should if possible
* Ensure that hardware devices are consistent.
* remove space between ‘contributors’ and ‘answer’ – I think this only happens
  when All contributors are selected…or actually, only when there is no age
  group selected
* There is a space at the beginning of the line indicating the type of people
  speaking “_male doctors…” – please remove – I think it’s only when the line
  begins with the gender.
* That same line should begin with a capital – right now, it does so only when
  “All” is indicated


OTHER LIST:
* Add an option to see a certain log level in the logging. Default to INFO
* Clean up what is printed to the logs. Make sure all events are recorded
  to the info that should be.
* create a log for the client so we can replay any errors that may occur.
* Create an install script for the server which installs all dependancies
  and sets up the database.
* Speaking of fading in, the whole stream should fade in and fade
  out for each session
* We probably should implement the check box functionality for
  Type (like in pauseplay) so people can check nurses AND patients, for
  example
* Eventually, it would still be nice to add the individual
  recording volume adjustment capability…you haven't done this yet,
  right?
* Panning seems to be funky.  I have it set for 0,0, so there should be no
  panning, correct?  But there is panning anyway.
* Create a web admin for the categories, questions, compositions, etc.
  This will be specific to roundware so things like maxdeadair can be
  displayed in second instead of nanoseconds.

DONE?:
* There are definitely still some pops and clicks in the
  playback…is icecast buffering properly?  It does start playing right
  away which suggests little or no buffering.  Perhaps it is having
  trouble keeping up because it has no buffer?  Usually if I stop the
  stream and start again, it will be better.
