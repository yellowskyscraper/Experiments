1995 was a great year...
It was also the year I got married... on Two Trees' property. :) It was beautiful!

	Really?
	Wow, that's great! How did you swing that?

		I think you have to know them...
		My family's been friends with the Vitalias for years. I don't think they let just anybody use the property, but maybe I'm wrong.

		We're thinking of opening up the place
		Hi, Polly! Love the username :) . We've been talking about making the property available for weddings and such, but haven't worked out the details. (Also, I think we'd need to upgrade our facilities a bit.) But watch this web site! If it happens, we'll post about it here. Thanks for the interest! --Maria Ann Vitalia
