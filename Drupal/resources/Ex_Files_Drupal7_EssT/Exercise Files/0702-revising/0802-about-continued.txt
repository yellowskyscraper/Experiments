CONTINUATION TEXT FOR THE "ABOUT US" PAGE

Our goal for the future is to continue to expand our oil varieties, while adding other delicious and inspired products to our recently developed and wildly successful bread and cracker line. In addition, we constantly strive to be the kind of company my grandparents would expect us to be, by giving back to our families, our people, and the world, because at the end of the day, these are the things that matter most.

Thank you for your interest in Two Trees Olive Oil. We hope you enjoy our products and invite you to send us your comments and suggestions by email to feedback@twotreesoliveoil.com.

Sincerely,

Maria Ann Vitalia & the Entire Vitalia family
