How about an herbal blend?
I like the basil, but wish it was a more complex flavor. How about a mixture, like basil/rosemary/mint? I'm sure your experts will figure out the right balance. :)

Something sharp
Maybe a "hot oil" like you get in pots at some Chinese restaurants... red pepper, cayenne, something like that.
