New use for TTOO basil olive oil: pesto

I liked to use the basil-flavored olive oil for salads -- no surprise there. But then when I was crushing basic for pesto, it dawned on me: Why not use a mixture of green herbs with the basil olive oil? I tried it, and it's great!

I recommend adding a bit of mint and cilantro to a base of basil. Any other ideas?

Followup: Lemon olive oil also works for pesto

Strangely, TTOO's garlic olive oil didn't do much for me -- probably because I was already using so much garlic, I couldn't tell the difference. Soo-eee!

What flavors should we introduce next?

So -- we have garlic, lemon, and basil olive oil already. What comes next?

We'll take your suggestions here, then post a poll soon so you can vote on them.

Rub it on!

I know, I know... I'm late to the party. But I just started using Two Trees Olive Oil as a moisturizer, and I'm thrilled with how it feels! A few things to know:

1) It's going to feel a bit more "oily" than a lot of moisturizers. But hey -- It's <i>oil</i>. So just give it a bit more time to soak in.

2) You don't need much!

3) Make sure you're using fresh olive oil: While cooking will mask a smack of rancidity, you really don't want that on your skin.

Enjoy!
